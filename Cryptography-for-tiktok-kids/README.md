# Cryptography for Tik-Tok kids üê£üçº

**ü§î What is this for?**: Protecting your info üìñ, silly messages üìß, passwords üîë, hentai urls ü•õ, anything basically. You can event convert images to those encodings.

## ü§® How to use it?

There is few types of crypto (not cringe ahhh NFTs üò°). Here is main encoding types: `base16`, `base32`, `base64`. Just like stacks separation in `Minecraft` üßä it resembles bits and stuff that divided easily. (16, 32, 64).

Here is how encoded message `pls register at minty.bar` looks in those types:

> base16: 706C73207265676973746572206174206D696E74792E626172
> base32: OBWHGIDSMVTWS43UMVZCAYLUEBWWS3TUPEXGEYLS
> base64: cGxzIHJlZ2lzdGVyIGF0IG1pbnR5LmJhcg==

### Base16

**How to see if its it?**: Numbers `0-9` and letters `A` to `F`. **Limited** alphabet, huge amount of additional text.
**How to hide my message?**: Use (online encoder)[https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/hex_encode.html] or write your own.
**How to see hidden message?**: Use (online decoder)[https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/hex_decode.html] or write your own.

### Base32

**How to see if its it?**: Numbers `2-7` and letters `A` to `Z`. **Entire** alphabet, **limited** numbers.
**How to hide my message?**: Use (online encoder)[https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/base32_encode.html] or write your own.
**How to see hidden message?**: Use (online decoder)[https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/base32_decode.html] or write your own.

### Base64

**How to see if its it?**: Numbers `0-9`, letters `A` to `Z` or `a` to `z`, symbols `/`, `+`, `=`. **Case-sensitive**, could be symbols in the end.
**How to hide my message?**: Use (online encoder)[https://www.base64encode.org/] or write your own.
**How to see hidden message?**: Use (online decoder)[https://www.base64decode.org/] or write your own.

<hr>

ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è There is also some ciphers. The easiest one is ü•ó `Caesar Cipher` which is really easy to decode. All it does just shifts üî§‚û°Ô∏è a letter in alphabet by `X` times.

> So, if I say `u r gay` in `Caesar Cipher` with `ROT8` means its shifted 8 times and it will be: `c z oig`.

**How to hide my message?**: Use (online encoder)[https://planetcalc.com/1434/] or just shift each letter in alphabet by `X` times.
**How to see hidden message?**: Use (online decoder)[https://planetcalc.com/1434/] or just shift each letter in alphabet by `X` times.
