# Cryptography for Tik-Tok kids 🐣🍼

**🤔 What is this for?**: Protecting your info 📖, silly messages 📧, passwords 🔑, hentai urls 🥛, anything. You can even convert pics.

## 🤨 How to use it?

There is few types of crypto (not cringe ahhh NFTs 😡). Here is main encoding types: `base16`, `base32`, `base64`. Just like stacks separation in `Minecraft` 🧊 it resembles bits and stuff that divided easily. (16, 32, 64). Since 1 byte has 8 bits, blah blah, doesnt matter, examples:

Here is how encoded message `pls register at minty.bar` looks in those types:

> base16: 706C73207265676973746572206174206D696E74792E626172

> base32: OBWHGIDSMVTWS43UMVZCAYLUEBWWS3TUPEXGEYLS

> base64: cGxzIHJlZ2lzdGVyIGF0IG1pbnR5LmJhcg==

### Base16

$\color{gray}{\textsf{How to know is that it?}}$: Numbers `0-9` and letters `A` to `F`. **Limited** alphabet, huge amount of additional text.

$\color{orange}{\textsf{How to hide message?}}$: Use [online encoder](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/hex_encode.html) or write your own.

$\color{violet}{\textsf{How to see message?}}$: Use [online decoder](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/hex_decode.html) or write your own.

### Base32

$\color{gray}{\textsf{How to know is that it?}}$: Numbers `2-7` and letters `A` to `Z`. **Entire** alphabet, **limited** numbers.

$\color{orange}{\textsf{How to hide message?}}$: Use [online encoder](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/base32_encode.html) or write your own.

$\color{violet}{\textsf{How to see message?}}$: Use [online decoder](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/base32_decode.html) or write your own.

<br>

### Base64

$\color{gray}{\textsf{How to know is that it?}}$: Numbers `0-9`, letters `A` to `Z` or `a` to `z`, symbols `/`, `+`, `=`. **Case-sensitive**, could be symbols in the end.

$\color{orange}{\textsf{How to hide message?}}$: Use [online encoder](https://www.base64encode.org/) or write your own.

$\color{violet}{\textsf{How to see message?}}$: Use [online decoder](https://www.base64decode.org/) or write your own.

🤓☝️ There is also some ciphers. The easiest one is 🥗 `Caesar Cipher` which is really easy to decode. All it does just shifts 🔤➡️ a letter in alphabet by `X` times.

> So, if I say `u r gay` in `Caesar Cipher` with `ROT8` means its shifted 8 times and it will be: `c z oig`.

$\color{orange}{\textsf{How to hide message?}}$: Use [online encoder](https://planetcalc.com/1434/) or just shift each letter in alphabet by `X` times.

$\color{violet}{\textsf{How to see message?}}$: Use [online decoder](https://planetcalc.com/1434/) or just shift each letter in alphabet by `X` times.
